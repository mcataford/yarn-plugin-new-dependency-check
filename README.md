ðŸ“¦ Never accidentally pull in a billion new dependencies again.

## Thoughts

One of the things I've come to love about how Linux prompts users when installing dependencies is that it makes it
explicit how many packages will be fetched.

```bash
Î» sudo apt install cowsay
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Suggested packages:
  filters cowsay-off
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  cowsay
0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

When compared to the NodeJS ecosystem, this is vastly superior in that you can't really unknowning depend on a million
things without having been explicitly notified about how many additional packages you were adding to your dependency
tree along the way.

With this lack of awareness as well as how much NodeJS relies on adopting third-party packages, it's no wonder
dependency hell is a thing.

__This plugin attacks this problem from the angle of awareness -- by surfacing what's being installed (including
transitive dependencies), you can make informed decisions about whether a certain package is worth it or not.__
